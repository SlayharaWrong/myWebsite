<h1>Rats are the Best!</h1>
<h2>Here's why...</h2>

<h3>
These are two pet Fancy Rats (Rattus norvegicus domestica). The fancy rat is the domesticated form of Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat, and the most common species of rat kept as a pet. The name fancy rat derives from the use of the adjective fancy for a hobby, also seen in "animal fancy", a hobby involving the appreciation, promotion, or breeding of pet or domestic animals.Rats are often preferred as pets for their intelligence, social nature, and ease of care compared to dogs. They require less space, have a shorter lifespan, and can bond closely with their owners. Understanding rat care and behavior is essential for a rewarding pet ownership experience.
</h3>
<h2>
They also have important jobs!
</h2>
<h3>
Rats have been used as working animals. Tasks for working rats include the sniffing of gunpowder residue, demining, acting and animal-assisted therapy. Rats have a keen sense of smell and are easy to train. These characteristics have been employed, for example, by the Belgian non-governmental organization APOPO, which trains rats (specifically African giant pouched rats) to detect landmines and diagnose tuberculosis through smell.
